We want to give people better sleep using REM cycles

Use FitBit Studio and make a new project and then post the folder containing this file into a new project

Connect the FitBit and your phone to the app on your mobile device. Make sure that you enable the Developer Bridge in both your phone and your FitBit

Click run to launch the application and load it onto the FitBit

Go into the app and click on the device menu --> developer menu --> side loaded apps; under that click the PowerNap option

Click settings and then adjust the slider according to how many sleep cycles you want(how much you want to sleep)

Sleep! You will be awoken once you have reached the specified number of sleep cycles
